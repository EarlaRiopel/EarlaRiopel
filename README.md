Hi, My name is Earla Riopel.
I’m currently learning GitHub in my CSIS 3200 (Applied Knowledge Management), at Douglas College with Professor Anu Gupta.
I'm looking forward to learn the GitHub app for educational purchases. 
I can be reached at earlariopel@gmail.com
⚡ Fun fact: I'm an older student in my 50s. This would be my 5th undergraduate credential, graduating in Winter 2025.
